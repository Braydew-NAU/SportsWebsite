## Tests
The framework used to develop our tests was Jest and JavaScript scripts to automate our testing. The folder on our GitHub where our automated tests are located are in the [\_tests_](https://github.com/Braydew-NAU/SportsWebsite/tree/main/_tests_) folder. The class being tested is the [display movies class](https://github.com/Braydew-NAU/SportsWebsite/blob/main/script.js) and here is the [test](https://github.com/Braydew-NAU/SportsWebsite/blob/main/_tests_/displayMovies.test.js). And here is a print screen of the result of the automated tests output ![TestResults](Test_Result.png)

## Technology
<br>
HTML5: HTML is used in the front end creation of the website. It creates the initial layout and sets up the basic outline for the website. In the HTML file, it references both a JS and a CSS file that helps to displays our information. 
<br>
<br>
CSS3: CSS is also used in the front end creation for the website. This is used to create a better appeal for the website, creating how each area should look and the space and font size that should go with it. 
<br>
<br>
JS: This is also part of the front end creation. The JavaScript is responsible for creating the website by being able to fetch the catalog, display movies, and implement and respond to the search bar. 
<br>
<br>
Git: Git was used to keep track of where the website is in progress. Each person would submit their changes or their comments through there and Git tracks all the changes and updates. 
<br>
<br>
Virtual Studio Code: This is where most of our code has been developed and tested. VS Code will allow us to modify all our codes and csv files. VS Code also allows for our testing of the sight. It allows for us to run a live version of what the website should look like.

## Deployment
For this project, the system is hosted locally rather than using a cloud-based deployement. The deployment process involves setting up a local server environment, configuring dependencies, and ensuring accessibility within a local network. The system is deployed on a local machine running macOs. Node.js is installed and configured. 

## Licensing
This project is taking on the MIT licensing because it is short and to the point. It lets people do almost anything they want with our project, like making and distributing closed source versions.

## Lessons Learned
Communication: We learned the amount of communication that is NEEDED to succeed in creating a project of this size. 
<br>
Ordered Code: We learned that we should be aware of what the others are trying to create in case the codes are interlinked. 
<br>
Test Cases: We got to learn how to apply the processes needed to create our own test cases for each of our classes. 
<br>
We are going to change how we maintain the current implemented code. Before we were just using one branch per person for all changes, but next release we are going to create a new branch from main for each feature we need to implement. That way we dont overwrite other devs code. As well as better communication it took til the last week to fully figure out the level of communication needed to complete this project. We are going to be implementing a weekly check in with each other to make sure we are getting everything we need and following the proper protocols.
