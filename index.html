            This is where I will be showing you some of my HTML skills. 

            <!-- making a line break to start a new line -->
            <br>
            Right now I used a tag that starts whatever I am typing after on a new line. 

            <!-- bolding a sentence and explaining -->
            <b>
                Now I am making this sentence bold by putting a starting tag before and a ending tag after so I know what exactly I am making bold. 
            </b>

            <!-- making something italisized -->
            <i>
                This sentence is italisized by using the same technique above just with different words to describe what tag I want to be done. 
            </i>
            <!-- making a word strong -->
            I am now going to make a word look 
            <strong>
                strong
            </strong>
            by using the strong tag. 
            <br>
            That is all for now but stay tuned for I hope to learn more throughout the semester.

            For this project I have to go outside somewhere and take pictures of things that are

                interesting.

            For this project I had to

            <u>
                code a game
            </u> 
            where you guess a number and the closer the number that you guessed on the game board was to 1 the closer you were to winning. You had to keep guessing where on the board and using a
            <u>
                "hot or cold"
            </u> 
            type of rules is how you decided where to go next. This project was quite

                hard

            and I hope to learn and do better on the next project coming up which might involve using x<sup>2</sup> in the code.

        <p>
            This one was less of a project and more of a homework assignment. What I had to do was create 
            <!-- underline what I had to do -->
            <u>
                truth tables
            </u> 
            for circuits, take the 

            <!-- underline another thing I had to find -->
            <u>
                minterms
            </u> 
            from the truth table and create a new circuit. Another thing that I had to do was take decimal numbers and turn them into 
            
            <!-- bolding the important word because binary is how computers talk -->
            <b>
                binary 
            </b>
            but some numbers were so large that we had to use base 2 instead of 10. We have to be specific with how we write our numbers because 1011 could be something different in binary so we have to use subscrips like 1011<sub>10</sub>. Very informational and challenging.

            I then was deciding where to go to school. I wanted to go to school somewhere hot so I looked at schools in AZ. I visited

            All of the other schools were so expensive because they didn't have the
