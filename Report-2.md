# 1. Activity Summary
## Everyone: 
- Everyone got their interviews done and we all got 2 interviews each. 
## Mitchelle:
- He got a mock up of the website. A dry look at the flow fo the website. He put it into GitHub under an index.html
## Diego A
- He got a good amount of feed back from initial interviews and has gave the team some more ideas of the direction we can take. 
## Braydon
- Braydon was looking at some of the databases from which we can pull from. It does seem that it will be a bit of a challenge. 
## Diego D
- Diego Looked at some of the other apps and websites that could potentially be a threat to ours. He looked at big apps such as ESPN, each leagues apps, and other sites such as Hulu or other streaming services. 
## Tyler
- Tyler took the two Diego's input and looked for some new ideas that both were not in our competitors sites, while integrating the interviewees feedback. There is some common ground on what our competitors do badly and what the interviewees would like to see.

## 1. <small>Appreciations: Mitchelle was the MVP of the week as he gave the barebones of the webiste, which now the team can focus on the desgin with some visualization.</small>
## 2.<small>Successes: The entrie team did great with all the interviews. The team now has a good range of feedback and a better understanding of what sport fans need. </small>
## 3. <small>Failures: We didn't get much progress done execpt feedback and a dry mock up. </small>
## 4. <small>Barriers: We didn't get a solid idea of our website until very late in the week so it made it hard for us to work towards a solid goal. </small>
## 5. What we shoudl try next time: <small>We did meet on the phone and I think what we should do is meet in person with more ideas and solid plans</small>

## Diego A
- Turn the feedback from the interview into ideas
- Have a solid outline of how the website will look 
## Braydon
-  Braydon will find a way to access and implement the databases
