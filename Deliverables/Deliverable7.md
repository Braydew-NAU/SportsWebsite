## Verification

## Acceptance Test

## Validation
Script:

I tasks that were given to the user were to first just explore the webpage, then it was to test out the sorting features as well as the search feature, after that we guide them to the schedule side to see if they like that newer update, and lastly it was to leave a review on a movie they have seen before. 

Here is what was asked after the tasks:

On your first look how would you describe the webpage (Organized, sloppy, pleasing to the eye)?

User1: Simple and easy to navigate.
User 2: Organized and easy to look at. 
User 3: It is very organized and easy to follow. 

After just going around without instruction, what would you have done differently with the presentation?

User 1: Layout was good but maybe add some difference in color other than white and green. 
User 2: The layout was mostly good but with the sorting by favorite sport I would alphabetize them. 
User 3: I would have maybe done separate sections for the different sports. Like a Disney+ thing that has Marvel, Star Wars or even just a tab for the different sports. 

On a scale from 1-10 how would you rate the layout?

User 1: 9
User 2: 7
User 3: 9

Did you like the features, or would you change them (Layout or functionality)?

User 1: I liked the layouts and wouldn’t remove any as well as I liked where they were placed. 
User 2: I liked the features, maybe a section to add a new movie. As well I would put the movies that are currently about a sport that is happening right now. 
User 3: I don’t think the organize by sport function is needed if you have the drop down menu for recommendations.

How did you feel about the schedule side?

User 1: I thought it was cool and creative; it was nice as well for having NAU on top. If you could add in the future having your favorite games at the top when you visit that side of the website. 
User 2: It was a cool touch to add reality and fiction. I don’t really watch baseball movies until baseball season is on so seeing the schedule of games and then seeing reviews made me want to watch some of the movies. 
User 3: I thought it was good and organized. I would have liked maybe an additional women’s sport page. Further in the future, clicking on the game should give you information on it as well as being able to see past and future games. 

What were the strong parts of the webpage (Layout and functionality)?

User 1: The quickness of the functionality, as well as sorting automatically did it then and there instead of searching through things. The layout was simple and pleasing. 
User 2: Functionality was very easy, very strong because of the simplicity when looking at it without too much information. The cover picture was nice because if you don’t remember the name, you get a better reference with the poster. 
User 3: The structure was helpful in order to know how to work the webpage. The font size was good, and the movie descriptions were a nice touch.

How likely would you use this website 1-10?

User 1: Probably a 6. Schedule thing was cool. 
User 2: An 8, again the schedule was cool. 
User 3: An 8 because the description of the movies and leaving a review is cool. 

Results:

The functionality worked for everything as well as being easy to understand and use. The layout was helped because it was organized making it easier to follow everything on the webpage. Doing more with the schedule side would be a great addition to a future update. 

Reflection:

Throughout the entire experience the users never had a problem figuring out how to do a functionality or where to go to find what they need. Something they kept requesting though was more stuff on the schedule side like updates, past games, game information which could be the main focus if an update was wanted. I think something that could be changed is removing the drop-down menu or removing the sort by sport. Overall the users had a good easy experience with the webpage and got what they wanted from it giving us what we wanted.
