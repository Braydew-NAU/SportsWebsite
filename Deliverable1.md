# 1. **Introduction**

The project is aimed at developing an all-in-one platform that serves as a comprehensive resource for sports enthusiasts, particularly focusing on sports movies and live sports schedules, including broadcasting information. This platform will address the problem of fragmented information sources that sports fans typically face when trying to find details on specific sports movies and live game schedules across multiple broadcasting platforms. By consolidating these features into one user-friendly interface, the solution aims to simplify the experience for fans who seek quick, reliable, and easy access to a wide range of sports-related content.

The platform allows users to plan their viewing experience and track sports movies. This unique combination adds value by saving time and offering a richer, more integrated experience for fans of all kinds of sports.
